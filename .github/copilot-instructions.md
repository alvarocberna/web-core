# GitHub Copilot / AI Agent instructions for web-core

Purpose: provide concise, actionable information for AI agents to be productive quickly in this repository.

## Big picture / architecture
- Project uses **NestJS** with a light DDD-like structure under `src/`:
  - `presentation/` — controllers, DTOs, filters, guards, strategies (http layer).
  - `domain/` — use-cases, entities, interfaces (business rules). Example: `src/domain/use-cases/create-articulo.use-case.ts`.
  - `infrastructure/` — datasources, repositories, Prisma ORM client wrappers.
- Controllers call *Service* (presentation) → service delegates to **domain use-cases** → repositories talk to DB (Prisma).
- Authentication: **JWT stored in cookies** (`access_token`, `refresh_token`), handled in `src/presentation/auth/` (AuthController, AuthService, JwtStrategy, JwtAuthGuard).

## Key flows & integration points
- Auth flow:
  - Login issues `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies (httpOnly, sameSite: 'lax'). See `src/presentation/auth/auth.controller.ts`.
  - `JwtStrategy` reads the token from cookie with `cookieExtractor` and verifies it. The `validate(payload)` returns a `user` object which gets attached to `req.user`. See `src/presentation/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`.
  - Guarded routes use `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` to ensure `req.user` is present.
  - Frontend must send cookies on requests (`fetch(..., { credentials: 'include' })` or `axios` with `withCredentials: true`). CORS is configured with `credentials: true` using `URL_FRONTEND` from env. See `src/main.ts`.

## DTOs & validation (important)
- Global `ValidationPipe` is enabled in `src/main.ts` with `whitelist: true` and `forbidNonWhitelisted: true` and `transform: true`.
  - Consequence: any body property without validation decorators (class-validator metadata) will be rejected with `property X should not exist`.
- Conventions:
  - DTOs live in `src/presentation/<resource>/dto` and typically have `CreateXDtoImpl` and `UpdateXDtoImpl` types.
  - For PATCH endpoints prefer `PartialType(CreateDto)` (from `@nestjs/mapped-types`) so updates can be partial.
  - Use `class-transformer` `@Type(() => Date)` for dates and `@Type(() => SubDto)` plus `@ValidateNested({ each: true })` for nested arrays (e.g., `sec_articulo`).

## Common pitfalls and project-specific rules
- Exports must be providers in the same module. If you export a strategy or provider, also include it in `providers` of that module (see fix in `src/presentation/auth/auth.module.ts`).
- Routes must use the correct HTTP method; e.g., `@Patch('/editar/:id')` expects `PATCH`, not `POST`.
- `req.user` exists only on routes protected by `JwtAuthGuard` because Passport/Guard performs token extraction and `validate()` and attaches the object.
- Prisma client is used via a wrapper `PrismaService` which points to the generated client under `generated/prisma/client`. If you change the schema run `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma migrate dev` when appropriate.
- Error formatting: `HttpExceptionFilter` (`src/presentation/filters/http-exception.filter.ts`) normalizes errors; prefer to inspect `message` and `statusCode` from its output when debugging.

## Useful files & locations (quick references)
- Entry & global config: `src/main.ts` (ValidationPipe, cookie parser, CORS, filters)
- Auth: `src/presentation/auth/{auth.controller.ts,auth.service.ts,auth.module.ts,strategies/jwt.strategy.ts,guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts}`
- DTO examples: `src/presentation/articulo/dto/{create-articulo.dto.ts,update-articulo.dto.ts}`
- Domain use-cases: `src/domain/use-cases/*` (e.g., `create-articulo.use-case.ts`)
- Repositories: `src/infrastructure/repository/*` and datasources in `src/infrastructure/datasources/*`.
- Prisma ORM wrapper: `src/infrastructure/orm/prisma/prisma.service.ts` and generated client `generated/prisma/`.

## Developer workflows (commands)
- Install: `npm install`
- Development server: `npm run start:dev`
- Production build/start: `npm run build` then `npm run start:prod` (or `npm run start` to run compiled app)
- Tests: `npm run test` (unit), `npm run test:e2e` (e2e), `npm run test:cov` (coverage)
- Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev` (local) and `npx prisma generate` when schema or client changes.

## Debugging tips (practical)
- For auth failures: inspect Network tab and check `Cookie: access_token=...` is sent and `credentials` is set.
- For validation errors: compare request payload with DTOs; remember `forbidNonWhitelisted` will reject unknown props.
- For module provider/export issues: confirm provider is listed in `providers` before exporting (UnknownExportException commonly triggers otherwise).
- For DB issues: check generated client and Prisma migrations; `generated/prisma` is committed in this repo, but regenerate after schema changes.

## Code style & conventions
- Types/DTO classes use `Impl` suffix (e.g., `CreateArticuloDtoImpl`).
- Files are organized by layer (presentation, domain, infrastructure). Keep that separation for new features.
- Use `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` to mark routes that require authentication and use a `@CurrentUser` decorator (recommended) to fetch `req.user` cleanly.
